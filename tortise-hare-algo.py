# The Singly Linked List is implemented as a list of nodes.
# Each node in the list is itself a 2-element list, where
# the first element is the number of the node, and
# the second element is the number of the node it points to.

# in looped_list, node 0 points to node 1, and so on, until node 6 points to node 3
# thus creating a loop.

looped_list = [ [0,1], [1,2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 3], [7, 8] ]


# in straight_list, node 0 points to node 1, and so on, all the way to the last node (8)
# thus creating a straight linked list with no loops.

straight_list = [ [0,1], [1,2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8] ]
